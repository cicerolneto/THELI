Before installing THELI, the following dependencies must be met:

For compilation, you need the 'devel' versions of the following packages
(either these version numbers, or more recent ones). Older versions might work but have not been tested.

Qt5.9.6         https://www.qt.io/
cfitsio         https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/
fftw3           http://fftw.org/
GSL v2.5        https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
wcslib v6.4     https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/
libraw v0.19.4  https://www.libraw.org/

On a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 LTS installation, the following command should resolve all dependencies and enable the compilation of 'scamp':

sudo apt install g++ build-essential autotools python python-requests libfftw3-dev libtiff-dev curl libcurl4 libcurl4-gnutls-dev qt5-default qt5-qmake libgsl-dev libatlas-base-dev libblas-dev libplplot-dev libcfitsio-dev libwcstools-dev

THELI also uses the following external packages.
The relevant binaries must be present in your $PATH variable.
THELI will check for their presence upon launch and report any misconfigurations.

swarp v2.38        https://www.astromatic.net/software/swarp
scamp v2.7         https://github.com/astromatic/scamp
sextractor v2.19   https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor
vizquery.py        http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/resources/doku.php?id=cdsclient
sesame             http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/ftp/pub/sw/cdsclient.tar.gz

In the following, we assume that the THELI source package was unpacked in a 'software' folder in your home
directory:

$HOME/software/THELI-master/

You must set the THELIDIR environment variable to this path, e.g. on bash you would do

export THELIDIR=$HOME/software/THELI-master/

To make it permanent, include this line in your ~/.bashrc

Now create the 'Makefile' and build it:

cd $HOME/software/THELI-master/src
qmake -o Makefile THELI.pro
make
make clean

To speed up the compilation on a multi-core system, you can replace 'make' by 'make -j x",
where 'x' is replaced by the number of CPUs you have available.

The 'qmake' executable is part of the Qt5 dependence you have installed in the beginning.
